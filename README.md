# UnpackCustomizing
Unpack customizing content to run your application

# Motivation
Since the introduction of [abapGit](https://docs.abapgit.org), there are several projects or application created by our developers/partners/customers.
Some application needs a configuration content without which the application cannot be used. Such content is either created manually or using [BC Sets](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit/issues/1004), the content is deployed via SCPR20 transaction.
This involves some manual steps like, creation of content manually or incase of BC sets, then SCPR20 transaction needs to be used for activation.
